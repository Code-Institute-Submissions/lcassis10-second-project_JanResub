# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock Game is a simple and easy to understand game, it is a derivation of the rock, paper, scissors game.

It was created based on the television series "The Big Bang Theory".

The game can be played by both adults and children. To start it is very simple, the user selects one of the options and the computer randomly chooses an option. Once both players have chosen their options, the game will show who won and which option was chosen by each. Depending on who wins, your score will be updated and the game will continue as long as the user is interested.

The game is compatible with any screen size, from cell phones to computer screens.
